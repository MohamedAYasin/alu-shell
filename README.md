# ALU Shell

In this repo, you will find different programs written on Shell and how it works for the ALU BSE program. While working on these projects, I was able to learn scripting with bash efficiently and also how to navigate through the terminal. Below are the projects I have worked on:

* [Shell, basics](basics)
* [Shell, permissions](permissions)
* [Shell, I/O Redirections and filters](io_redirections_and_filters)
* [Shell, init files, variables and expansions](init_files_variables_and_expansions)
* [Shell, loops, conditions and parsing](loops_conditions_and_parsing)
* [Shell, processes and signals](processes_and_signals)

- I am commited to continuosly updating this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed above.
